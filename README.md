# Penetration Testing Repository

This repository contains penetration testing write-ups, and custom scripts. I've included reports from various challenges and real-world scenarios from platforms like Hack The Box, OffSec, TryHackMe, and Virtual Hacking Labs. Additionally, I’ve included custom scripts I developed for specific penetration testing tasks.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Machine Reports
In the `Reports` folder, you’ll find professionally formatted PDF reports. Summarizing key findings and methodologies from a selected machines. This section is designed to provide quick access to my most significant work.

### 2. Write-Ups
In the `Write-ups` folder, you’ll find comprehensive reports on various virtual machines I’ve completed. These write-ups are organized by platform and then by individual machine name. Each report covers:
- **Machine Overview**: Information about the target system.
- **Enumeration**: Identify open ports, services, and potential attack vectors.
- **Exploitation**: Detailed methodology used to exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Escalation of privileges and collection of sensitive data or insights to deepen access in the environment.
- **Remediation**: Suggestions for mitigating the discovered vulnerabilities.

#### Write-Ups Structure
Each machine folder contains:
- A `README.md` file for the step-by-step guide.
- Screenshots to illustrate key steps and findings.

### 3. Custom Scripts
In the `Scripts` folder, you’ll find custom scripts I’ve created to assist in penetration testing. These scripts were created for personal use to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Description**: Explains the tool’s purpose and typical use cases.
- **Usage Instructions**: Provides command-line syntax and usage examples.
- **Dependencies**: Lists required Python packages and modules, if any.

#### Custom Scripts Structure
Each script folder contains:
- A `README.md` file for the step-by-step usage guide.
- Screenshots to illustrate script usage.
